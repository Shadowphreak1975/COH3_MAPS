SHARING SO OTHERS CAN USE, LEARN, AND CREATE THEIR OWN AWESOME-NESS

READ ME FIRST

- This is the entire (4) COMP STOMP III - HORDE MODE map.

I released this source map because many people are asking how its done and want to create their own designs.

The basic map entities are simple.

The magic happens in the PREFABS section. Open this up to view all the Playbills. 

Check my Playbill guide on Steam Workshop Guides for information on Playbills.

How this level works,

There are 5 waves to this map (Sequences)

PB_Supply_Missions - Starts the mission to spawn supply trucks.

PB_INTRO1 - Starts Wave 1
PB_ATTACK_SEQ... - What entities are attacking, and loops
PB_WIN_SEQ... - How long match goes.

this is continued through to wave 5.

Some sequences have PB_PRE_ATTACK is just a smaller attack wave.

PB_SPAWN... are the entites that appear in the map.
PB_ATTACK... are scripts that tell the entites to attack.

Then they are custom ones that are self explanitory. supply drops, kill waves, etc...

Feel free to experiment and learn all about Playbills.

My methods and organization of Playbills may not be the best way, but it works. :)
